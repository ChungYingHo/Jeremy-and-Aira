    description: 'Hi, I’m Jeremy, a front-end engineer.\nI believe that even small, consistent efforts can gradually make a difference in the world.\n\nWelcome to the Jeremy & Aira blog. From vocus to Docusaurus, this is already the fourth iteration of this site. Each redesign has been more than a change of tools or frameworks — it has been a way for me to reorganize how I learn and how I think.\n\nHere, you’ll find practical insights into web development, deeper explorations of computer science fundamentals, and reflections on technical growth and life choices.\n\nFor me, this blog represents an important milestone. It serves both as a record of my technical journey and as a starting point for redefining my future direction.\nWhether you’re just passing by or choosing to walk along for a while, I’m truly glad to meet you here.',
